The new features are working. Let me provide a summary of what was added:

**Changes Made:**

1. **Added two new date shortcuts in `src/utils/date.ts`:**
   - `endofthismonth` - Returns the last day of the current month (useful for planning)
   - `endoflastweek` - Returns last Sunday (end of previous week, completing the week query pattern)

2. **Updated flag descriptions in `src/utils/flags.ts`:**
   - Added the new shortcuts to the `--until` flag description

3. **Added example in `src/commands/transactions.ts`:**
   - Added `--since lastweek --until endoflastweek` example for querying a full week

4. **Added 3 new tests in `test/utils/date.test.ts`:**
   - Test for `endofthismonth`
   - Test for `endoflastweek`
   - Case-insensitivity test for `ENDOFLASTWEEK`

**Why this improves the CLI:**

Users can now query complete time periods more naturally:
- `--since lastmonth --until endoflastmonth` - Full last month (already existed)
- `--since lastweek --until endoflastweek` - Full last week (Mon-Sun) (NEW)
- `--since thismonth --until endofthismonth` - Full current month including future (NEW)

This completes the pattern of start/end shortcuts for weeks and months, making the date filtering system more consistent and professional.

SUCCESS
