## Summary

**Improvement:** Show cache age when displaying cached data

Previously, when the CLI used cached data, it would simply show `(using cached data)`. This didn't tell users how stale the cache might be, which is important for financial data.

**Changes made:**

1. **Added `formatCacheAge()` utility** (`src/utils/output.ts`):
   - Returns human-readable cache age like `(using cached data from 45m ago)` or `(using cached data from 2h ago)`
   - Handles edge cases: null input, invalid dates
   - Shows appropriate units: minutes, hours, or days

2. **Updated CacheService** (`src/services/cache.service.ts`):
   - Modified `getAccountsWithCache()` and `getTransactionsWithCache()` to return `cacheAge` timestamp alongside `fromCache` boolean

3. **Updated all commands that use cache**:
   - `accounts.ts` - Shows cache age in table format
   - `transactions.ts` - Shows cache age in table format
   - `categories.ts` - Shows cache age
   - `overview.ts` - Shows cache age in the dashboard header

4. **Added 10 unit tests** for the new `formatCacheAge()` function covering:
   - Null input handling
   - Just now, minutes, hours, and days formatting
   - Edge cases at time boundaries (59m→60m, 23h→24h)
   - Invalid date string handling

**Impact:**
- Users now see exactly how old their cached data is
- Helps users make informed decisions about whether to use `--refresh`
- More professional CLI UX - transparent about data freshness
