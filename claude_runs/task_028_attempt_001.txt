All changes have been successfully implemented and verified. Here's a summary of the improvements made:

## Summary of Changes

### 1. New `--stats` Flag for Transactions Command
**File:** `src/commands/transactions.ts`

Added a `--stats` flag that provides a quick statistical summary without listing all transactions:
- Transaction count
- Income, spending, and net totals
- Average, min, and max transaction amounts
- Date range of data
- Count of unique merchants and categories

This is a high-impact UX improvement for power users who want quick insights without scrolling through transaction lists.

### 2. Fixed Merchant Name Normalization Bug
**Files:** 
- `src/services/merchant-mapping.service.ts` - Added exported `normaliseMerchantName()` function
- `src/services/transaction-processing.service.ts` - Now uses normalized lookup keys
- `src/commands/categorise.ts` - Uses shared normalization function

**Problem:** The `categorise` command saved merchant mappings with normalized keys (lowercase, special chars replaced), but the `transaction-processing.service` looked up mappings using raw merchant names from the API. This caused lookups to fail silently.

**Solution:** Centralized the normalization logic in `merchant-mapping.service.ts` and used it consistently in both saving (categorise) and lookup (transaction-processing) operations.

### 3. Updated Tests
**File:** `test/commands/transactions.test.ts`
- Added tests for `--stats` flag
- Added tests for mutual exclusivity with other output flags
- Updated error message expectations

**File:** `test/services/transaction-processing.service.test.ts`
- Updated merchant mapping tests to use normalized keys
- Tests now properly verify the normalized lookup behavior

### Verification
