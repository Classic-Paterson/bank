The fix is working correctly:
- `-s` is now correctly mapped to `--since` (the date filter)
- `--summary` no longer has a short flag (which avoids the collision)

The help output clearly shows:
- `-s, --since=<value>` for the date filter
- `--summary` (no short flag) for the spending summary

This is a **correctness fix** that prevents a real bug where users typing `bank transactions -s` might get unexpected behavior due to the flag collision.

## Summary

**Fixed: Flag collision in transactions command**

The `transactions` command had a bug where both `--since` (date filter) and `--summary` (spending summary) were assigned the `-s` short flag. This caused ambiguous behavior where oclif would silently pick one flag over the other.

**Changes made:**
1. `src/commands/transactions.ts`: Removed `char: 's'` from the `summary` flag definition
2. `test/commands/transactions.test.ts`: Updated test name and behavior to correctly reflect that `-s` is the shorthand for `--since` (date filter)

**Impact:**
- Users can now reliably use `-s thismonth` as shorthand for `--since thismonth`
- `--summary` must be typed in full (which is reasonable for an optional summary feature)
- No backwards compatibility concerns since the previous behavior was undefined/buggy

SUCCESS
