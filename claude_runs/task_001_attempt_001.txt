The critical issue (broken test suite) is now fixed. All 274 tests pass, lint passes, and build passes.

**Summary of fix:**
- The Akahu SDK types require `_id` on merchant objects and `_id` on the category group objects (e.g., `personal_finance`)
- Updated the test mock factory `createMockEnrichedTransaction` to include `_id: 'merch_123'` on the merchant object
- Updated all test cases that override the merchant to include `_id`  
- Updated all `personal_finance` group objects to include `_id`

SUCCESS
