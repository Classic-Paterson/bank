All checks pass. Here's a summary of the change:

## Summary

Added a `--merchants` flag to the `transactions` command that lists unique merchants from matching transactions, sorted alphabetically.

### Changes Made:

1. **`src/commands/transactions.ts`**:
   - Added `--merchants` flag (boolean) with description: "List unique merchants from matching transactions (sorted alphabetically)"
   - Updated mutually exclusive flag validation to include `--merchants` alongside `--count` and `--total`
   - Added handling that outputs merchants alphabetically, one per line, with a count summary
   - Updated the "tips" message for empty results to use the new `--merchants` flag instead of the jq workaround
   - Added two examples in the command help

2. **`test/commands/transactions.test.ts`**:
   - Updated the test for mutually exclusive flags to cover all combinations
   - Added test for `--merchants` flag

### Why This Matters:

- **Discoverability**: Users previously had to pipe through jq (`bank transactions --format json | jq -r ".[].merchant" | sort -u`) to see available merchants. Now it's `bank transactions --merchants`
- **No external dependencies**: Works without jq installed
- **Composable**: Works with all existing filters (e.g., `--parentCategory "Utilities" --merchants` to see merchants in a category)
- **Scriptable**: Output is one merchant per line (use `--quiet` to suppress the count summary)

SUCCESS
