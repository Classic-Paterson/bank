The change has been successfully implemented. Let me summarize what was done:

## Summary of Changes

**File Modified:** `src/commands/query.ts` (lines 307-324)

**Problem:** When a saved query returned no results, the message was minimal and unhelpful:
```
No transactions found for query "groceries" in the specified date range.
```

**Solution:** Updated the empty result handling to provide a much more helpful UX, matching the pattern used in the `transactions` command:

1. **Shows the date range** that was searched
2. **Lists all filters** that were applied (merchant, category, amount, direction, etc.)
3. **Provides actionable tips:**
   - Suggests trying a wider date range with the exact command
   - Shows how to view query details

**Example of new output:**
```
  No transactions found for query "groceries".
  Date range: 2025-01-05 to 2025-02-04

  Filters: merchant="Countdown,Pak N Save", parentCategory="food"

  Tips:
    - Try a wider date range: bank query run groceries --since 3m
    - View query details: bank query show groceries
```

This change:
- Is **user-facing** and directly improves CLI UX
- Is **small and reviewable** (25 lines changed)
- Has **no breaking changes**
- **Follows existing patterns** from the `transactions` command
- **All tests pass** (340 tests)
- **Lint passes**
- **Build succeeds**

SUCCESS
