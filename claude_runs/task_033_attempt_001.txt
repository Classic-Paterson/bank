I've made a high-impact UX improvement to the banking CLI:

**Feature Added: Daily Spending Rate Indicator**

The `overview` command now shows users their daily spending rate and whether they're on track for the period:

- **Daily avg**: Shows the average daily spending for the period (e.g., `$85.42/day`)
- **Pace indicator**: 
  - **green "on pace"** - spending at or below expected rate
  - **yellow "slightly over"** - up to 20% over expected
  - **red "over pace"** - more than 20% over expected rate

This feature:
1. Only appears for multi-day periods with spending (not for single-day views)
2. Only shows the pace indicator when viewing current/in-progress periods (not historical)
3. Uses color-coding for instant visual feedback
4. Helps users understand if their spending velocity is sustainable

Example output:
```
  THIS PERIOD (2024-01-01 to 2024-01-31, 31 days)

  Income:    $4,500.00
  Spending:  -$2,650.00
  Net:       $1,850.00
  Daily avg: $85.48/day  on pace
```

All 363 tests pass, and the build and lint succeed.

SUCCESS
