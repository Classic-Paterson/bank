**Summary of changes:**

Added `--quiet` (`-q`) flag to `accounts` and `transactions` commands. This flag:
- Suppresses "(using cached data)" messages
- Suppresses "No X found matching your criteria" messages  
- Suppresses table summary lines (total counts/balances)

This makes the CLI more script-friendly when piping output to tools like `jq`, `grep`, or when embedding in shell scripts.

Files modified:
