The improvement has been made successfully:

**Change Summary:**
- Added defensive error handling around JSON parsing in `src/commands/categorise.ts:19-24`
- Previously, if `nzfcc_categories.json` contained invalid JSON, the entire CLI would crash on startup
- Now, invalid JSON is handled gracefully - the command continues without category suggestions but remains functional

**Impact:**
- **Correctness**: Prevents crash from corrupted or malformed configuration file
- **UX**: Users can still categorize transactions manually even if the suggestion file is broken
- **Minimal change**: Single try-catch block, no new dependencies or complexity

**Verification:**
- Build: ✓ Compiles successfully
- Tests: ✓ All 47 tests passing
- Lint: ✓ No errors (only deprecation warnings from dependencies)

SUCCESS
