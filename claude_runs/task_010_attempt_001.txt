## Summary

I added the `endofthisweek` date shortcut to complement the existing week-based shortcuts. This is a small, high-impact improvement that:

**Changes Made:**
1. **`src/utils/date.ts`**: Added `endofthisweek` shortcut that returns the upcoming Sunday (or today if it's Sunday), consistent with how `endoflastweek` works
2. **`src/commands/transactions.ts`**: Added an example showing the new shortcut: `--since thisweek --until endofthisweek` for a full week query
3. **`test/utils/date.test.ts`**: Added 2 tests for the new shortcut (normal and case-insensitive)

**Why This Matters:**
- Completes the week-based date shortcut pattern (previously had `thisweek`, `lastweek`, `endoflastweek` but was missing `endofthisweek`)
- Enables queries like "all transactions for the full current week" using `--since thisweek --until endofthisweek`
- Follows existing patterns and conventions exactly
- Zero risk of breaking changes - purely additive

**Verification:**
- Build passes
- All 299 tests pass (297 existing + 2 new)
- Lint passes

SUCCESS
