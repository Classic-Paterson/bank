The implementation is complete. Here's a summary of the changes:

## Summary of Changes

**Added automatic retry with exponential backoff to ApiService** (`src/services/api.service.ts`)

This improves CLI reliability by automatically retrying API calls that fail due to transient errors:

**What gets retried:**
- Rate limiting (HTTP 429)
- Server errors (HTTP 5xx)
- Network errors: `ENOTFOUND`, `ECONNREFUSED`, `ECONNRESET`, `ETIMEDOUT`, `ESOCKETTIMEDOUT`, `EPIPE`

**Retry behavior:**
- Up to 3 retries by default
- Exponential backoff: 1s → 2s → 4s (base delays)
- ±25% jitter to prevent thundering herd
- Maximum delay capped at 10 seconds

**Safety consideration:**
- `initiateTransfer()` intentionally does NOT auto-retry to prevent duplicate transactions

**Tests added** (`test/services/api.service.test.ts`):
- 12 new tests covering `isRetryableError()`, `calculateBackoffDelay()`, and configuration defaults

SUCCESS
