The categories command now uses the shared `formatFlag` constant and works correctly.

Let me summarize the changes made:

## Summary of Changes

### 1. Fixed settings.ts `-h` flag conflict
**Issue**: The settings command defined a custom `-h` flag for showing available settings, which conflicts with oclif's reserved `-h` for help.

**Solution**: 
- Removed the custom `-h, --help` flag
- Added a new `help` action (`bank settings help`) that shows detailed setting information
- Updated examples and error messages to reflect the new action

### 2. Standardized categories.ts format flag
**Issue**: The categories command defined its own `format` flag inline instead of using the shared `formatFlag` constant from `utils/flags.ts`.

**Solution**:
- Replaced the inline flag definition with the shared `formatFlag` constant
- Removed unused `Flags` import and `OUTPUT_FORMATS` import
- This ensures consistency across all commands that use format flags

### 3. Improved merchant matching help text
**Issue**: The transactions command displayed a confusing tip: "Merchant names are case-insensitive but must match exactly" - this is contradictory (case-insensitive implies partial matching).

**Solution**:
- Updated the help text to accurately describe the behavior: "Merchant filter is case-insensitive and matches substrings (e.g., 'pak' matches 'Pak N Save')"
- This matches the actual implementation which uses `includes()` for substring matching

### 4. Added test for new settings help action
- Added a new test case to verify the `settings help` action works correctly

All tests pass (282 total), build succeeds, and linting passes.

SUCCESS
