## Changes Summary

### Feature: Added `--account` filter to `categories` and `overview` commands

This improvement adds consistency across commands by allowing users to filter spending analysis and financial overview to a specific account. Previously, only the `transactions` command supported this filter.

**Files modified:**

1. **`src/commands/categories.ts`**
   - Added `--account` / `-a` flag to filter spending by account
   - Added account fetching when filter is specified
   - Added account name resolution (by ID or partial name match)
   - Shows filtered account name when active
   - Added example in command help

2. **`src/commands/overview.ts`**
   - Added `--account` / `-a` flag to filter overview to specific account
   - Filters both current and previous period transactions (for `--compare`)
   - Shows account name in header when filtering
   - Added example in command help

3. **`test/commands/categories.test.ts`**
   - Added test for account filter flag

4. **`test/commands/overview.test.ts`**
   - Added test for account filter flag
   - Added test for account filter combined with `--compare` flag

**User benefit:**
- Users can now analyze spending by category for a specific account: `bank categories --account "Everyday"`
- Users can see a financial overview for a single account: `bank overview --account "Savings" --compare`
- Consistent flag behavior across `transactions`, `categories`, and `overview` commands

**Tests:** 340 passing (3 new)
