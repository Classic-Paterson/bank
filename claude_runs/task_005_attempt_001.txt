The improvement is complete. Here's what was changed:

## Summary of Changes

### Enhanced Empty State Messages

**`src/commands/transactions.ts`** - When no transactions match the search criteria, users now see:
- The exact date range that was searched
- All active filters displayed clearly
- Helpful debugging tips including:
  - Suggestion to widen the date range
  - A `jq` command to list available merchants
  - Note that merchant names are case-insensitive

**`src/commands/accounts.ts`** - When no accounts match, users now see:
- The filters that were applied
- Tips for debugging (remove filters, type case-insensitivity note)

### Before (unhelpful):
```
No transactions found matching your criteria.
```

### After (helpful):
```
No transactions found between 2024-01-01 and 2024-02-03.
Filters: merchant="Countdwn"

Tips:
  - Try a wider date range: --days 90
  - Check available merchants: bank transactions --days 30 --format json | jq -r ".[].merchant" | sort -u
  - Merchant names are case-insensitive but must match exactly
```

This change significantly improves the UX by helping users understand why they got no results and how to debug the issue - a common pain point in CLI tools.

SUCCESS
