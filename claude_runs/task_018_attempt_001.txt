The improvement has been successfully implemented:

**Change made**: Added a grand total row to the `categories` command output that sums all spending across categories per month.

**What it does**:
- For table format: Adds a `═════` separator followed by a `TOTAL` row showing the sum of all spending per month
- For other formats (json, csv, ndjson, list): Adds a `total` row with the same sums

**Why this is valuable**:
- Users no longer need to manually sum categories to see total monthly spending
- Makes the categories output immediately actionable for budgeting
- Consistent with how financial reports typically present data

**Files changed**: `src/commands/categories.ts:141-170`

SUCCESS
