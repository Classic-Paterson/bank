The changes I made are merged with pre-existing changes. Let me show a summary of what I specifically added:

**Summary of my changes:**

1. **New tests for combined filter scenarios** in `test/services/transaction-processing.service.test.ts`:
   - `combines direction "out" with amount filters to find spending in a range`
   - `combines direction "in" with amount filters to find income in a range`
   - `combines direction with merchant and amount filters`
   - `combines direction with category and amount filters`

2. **Improved flag descriptions** in `src/commands/transactions.ts`:
   - `minAmount`: "Minimum transaction amount (filters by magnitude, e.g., 50 matches both -$50 and +$50)"
   - `maxAmount`: "Maximum transaction amount (filters by magnitude, e.g., 100 matches both -$100 and +$100)"
   - `direction`: Now includes "Combine with --minAmount/--maxAmount to find transactions in a specific range."

3. **New example** in help text:
   - `--direction out --minAmount 50 --maxAmount 200  # Spending between $50-$200`

All 320 tests pass and linting is clean. The changes improve clarity for users wanting to filter transactions by amount range within a specific direction (spending or income), which is a common use case.

SUCCESS
