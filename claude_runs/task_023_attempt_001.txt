## Summary of Changes

**1. Removed dead code from `src/services/api.service.ts`:**
- Deleted the unused `listTransactions()` method (lines 102-161) that was never called anywhere in the codebase. All commands use `listAllTransactions()` instead.

**2. Added helper method to `src/services/cache.service.ts`:**
- Added `getCachedAccountsAsApiType()` method that encapsulates the repeated pattern of converting `AccountSummary[]` to `Account[]`-compatible format.

**3. Refactored three commands to use the new helper:**
- `src/commands/transactions.ts`: Removed 8 lines of duplicate conversion code
- `src/commands/overview.ts`: Removed 8 lines of duplicate conversion code  
- `src/commands/query.ts`: Removed 8 lines of duplicate conversion code
- Cleaned up unused `AccountSummary` imports from all three files

**Impact:**
- Reduced code duplication (~24 lines removed across 3 files)
- Eliminated 58 lines of dead code from `ApiService`
- Single source of truth for AccountSummary → Account conversion
- All 47 tests pass, build and lint succeed

SUCCESS
