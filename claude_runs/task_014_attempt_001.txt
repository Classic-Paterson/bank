The help text is correct and the flags are properly configured. The change was successful:

**Summary of changes:**
1. Added `dateFilterFlags()` function to `src/utils/flags.ts` - a composable factory function that creates consistent `--since`, `--until`, and `--days` flags with proper short flags (`-s`, `-u`) and descriptions including the default days value
2. Added `DateFilterFlags` type helper for TypeScript type inference
3. Updated `transactions.ts` to use `...dateFilterFlags(DEFAULT_TRANSACTION_DAYS_BACK)` instead of defining flags individually
4. Updated `categories.ts` to use `...dateFilterFlags(DEFAULT_CATEGORY_DAYS_BACK)` instead of defining flags individually

**Benefits:**
- **Reduced duplication**: ~18 lines of flag definitions replaced with 1 line per command
- **Consistency**: All date flags now have consistent `-s` and `-u` short flags across commands
- **Maintainability**: Changes to date flag behavior/descriptions only need to happen in one place
- **Developer experience**: Adding date filtering to new commands is now trivial

SUCCESS
