All tests pass and the build is successful.

## Summary

I added a `--total` flag to the `accounts` command that outputs only the total balance of matching accounts. This improvement:

**What it does:**
- `bank accounts --total` outputs just the total balance (e.g., `12345.67`)
- Combines with other filters: `bank accounts --type savings --total` gives total savings balance
- Outputs `0.00` when no accounts match criteria
- Uses consistent 2-decimal-place formatting (NZD)

**Why it's useful:**
- Enables scripting workflows (e.g., `SAVINGS=$(bank accounts --type savings --total)`)
- Provides parity with the `transactions` command which already had `--count` and `--total` flags
- Makes "What's my net worth?" a one-liner
- Clean output for piping into other tools

**Changes made:**
- `src/commands/accounts.ts`: Added `--total` flag and logic
- `test/commands/accounts.test.ts`: Added 2 tests for the new flag

SUCCESS
