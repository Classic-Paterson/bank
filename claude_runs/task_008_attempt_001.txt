The changes are complete. Here's a summary of what was improved:

## Changes Made

### 1. Improved `--quiet` flag description (`src/utils/flags.ts`)
- Updated the description from generic "Suppress informational messages (useful for scripting)" to clearly document what gets suppressed: "Suppress informational messages (cache status, summaries, tips)"
- Added clearer JSDoc comment explaining the behavior

### 2. Fixed category breakdown respecting `--quiet` (`src/commands/transactions.ts`)
- The category breakdown summary (shown with `--details` flag) was already within a `!flags.quiet` check, but I improved the code structure:
  - Added a guard to only show category breakdown when there are non-transfer transactions
  - Cleaned up formatting (removed extra newlines, better comment)
  - This ensures the detailed view output is consistent and predictable

Both changes make the CLI more predictable for users who expect `--quiet` to suppress all informational output except the actual data - essential for scripting workflows like piping output to `jq` or other tools.

SUCCESS
