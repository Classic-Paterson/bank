The implementation is complete. Here's a summary of the changes:

## Summary

Added a `--direction` filter to the `transactions` and `query` commands, allowing users to easily filter transactions by:
- `--direction in` - Show only income (positive amounts)
- `--direction out` - Show only spending/expenses (negative amounts)

### Files Modified:

1. **src/types/index.ts** - Added `direction?: 'in' | 'out'` to `TransactionFilter` interface
2. **src/services/transaction-processing.service.ts** - Added direction filter logic to `applyFilters()`
3. **src/commands/transactions.ts** - Added `--direction` flag and examples
4. **src/commands/query.ts** - Added `--direction` flag for saved queries
5. **test/services/transaction-processing.service.test.ts** - Added 4 unit tests for direction filter
6. **test/commands/transactions.test.ts** - Added 3 command-level tests

### Why this matters for users:
- Common use case: "Show me just my expenses" or "Show me just my income"
- Previously required workarounds with amount filters
- Works with saved queries - users can create "spending-only" or "income-only" query presets
- Intuitive naming: `in` (money coming in) and `out` (money going out)

### Tests:
- Build passes ✓
- All 229 tests pass (222 existing + 7 new) ✓
