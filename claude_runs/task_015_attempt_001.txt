All checks pass. Here's a summary of the improvements made:

## Summary of Changes

**Problem**: Users could specify both `--days` and `--since` flags without realizing that `--days` silently overrides `--since`. This could lead to unexpected results and confusion.

**Solution**: Added proactive UX improvements to make the CLI behave more transparently:

### 1. Warning when conflicting flags are provided
- Modified `parseDateRange()` in `src/utils/date.ts` to accept an optional `onWarning` callback
- When both `--days` and `--since` are provided, the callback is invoked with a clear message explaining which flag takes precedence

### 2. Updated help text
- Changed the `--days` flag description in `src/utils/flags.ts` from:
  `"Number of days to look back (default: N)"`
  to:
  `"Number of days to look back (default: N). Overrides --since if both provided."`

### 3. Integrated warning into commands
- Updated `transactions.ts`, `categories.ts`, and `overview.ts` to pass the warning callback (respecting `--quiet` mode)

### 4. Added unit tests
- Added 3 new tests in `test/utils/date.test.ts` to verify:
  - Warning callback is invoked when both flags provided
  - Warning callback is NOT invoked when only `--days` is provided
  - Warning callback is NOT invoked when only `--since` is provided

**Files modified**:
- `src/utils/date.ts` - Added `onWarning` callback support
- `src/utils/flags.ts` - Updated help text
- `src/commands/transactions.ts` - Pass warning callback
- `src/commands/categories.ts` - Pass warning callback  
- `src/commands/overview.ts` - Pass warning callback
- `test/utils/date.test.ts` - Added 3 new tests

SUCCESS
