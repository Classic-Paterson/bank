All changes have been implemented and verified. Here's a summary of what was done:

## Summary of Changes

### 1. Smart Time Presets (High-Impact UX Improvement)
Added intuitive date shortcuts that match how users naturally think about time periods:

**New presets added to `src/utils/date.ts`:**
- `thisweek` - First day of current week (Monday)
- `lastweek` - First day of previous week (Monday)
- `thisquarter` - First day of current quarter
- `lastquarter` - First day of previous quarter
- `thisyear` - First day of current year
- `lastyear` - First day of previous year

**Usage examples:**
```bash
bank transactions --since thismonth       # This month so far
bank transactions --since thisweek        # This week (Mon-today)
bank transactions --since thisquarter     # This quarter so far
bank transactions --since thisyear        # Year to date
bank categories --since lastquarter       # Last quarter spending
```

### 2. Fixed Empty State Handling in Categories Command
The `categories` command now provides helpful guidance when no spending is found instead of silently outputting nothing:

```
No spending found between 2024-01-01 and 2024-01-31.

This could be because:
  - No outgoing transactions exist in this date range
  - All transactions are internal transfers (excluded from spending)

Tips:
  - Try a wider date range: --days 90
  - Check your transactions: bank transactions --since 2024-01-01
```

### 3. Updated Documentation
- Updated flag descriptions in `src/utils/flags.ts` to list all available presets
- Added practical examples to command help text showing the new presets
- Updated error messages to mention more shortcut options
- Added 8 new unit tests for the new date presets

### Files Changed:
- `src/utils/date.ts` - Added 6 new date presets
- `src/utils/flags.ts` - Updated flag description
- `src/commands/categories.ts` - Fixed empty state handling + examples
- `src/commands/transactions.ts` - Added examples
