All tests pass and lint is clean.

**Summary of changes made:**

1. **Added `endofthisyear` date shortcut** in `src/utils/date.ts` - Returns December 31st of the current year
2. **Added `endoflastyear` date shortcut** in `src/utils/date.ts` - Returns December 31st of the previous year  
3. **Updated documentation** in the `tryParseDateShortcut` and `parseDate` function docstrings
4. **Updated the `--until` flag description** in `src/utils/flags.ts` to mention the new shortcuts
5. **Added 4 new tests** in `test/utils/date.test.ts` for the new shortcuts (including case-insensitivity tests)

**Why this is a high-impact improvement:**
- Completes the date shortcut vocabulary - users can now do `--since lastyear --until endoflastyear` for annual reports
- Follows the established pattern for week/month/quarter shortcuts
- Enables common use cases like year-end financial summaries
- Zero breaking changes - purely additive
- Small, focused change that earns its complexity

SUCCESS
