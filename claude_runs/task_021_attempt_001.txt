The implementation is complete. Here's a summary of the changes:

## Summary of Changes

**Feature Added: `--names` flag for the `accounts` command**

This improvement adds a new `--names` flag to the `accounts` command that outputs account names only (one per line), making it useful for:
- Scripting and automation
- Piping to other tools (e.g., `bank accounts --names | fzf`)
- Shell autocompletion
- Quick account listing without balance details

**Changes Made:**

1. **`src/commands/accounts.ts`:**
   - Added `--names` flag definition (lines 46-49)
   - Added example usage in command help (line 26)
   - Added validation to prevent using `--total` and `--names` together (lines 57-60)
   - Added logic to output account names when `--names` is used (lines 178-188)
   - Updated empty results handling for `--names` flag (lines 149-152)

2. **`test/commands/accounts.test.ts`:**
   - Added 3 new tests:
     - `handles --names flag`
     - `handles --names with type filter`
     - `rejects --total and --names together`

**Design Considerations:**
- Follows the existing pattern from `--merchants` flag on the transactions command
- Supports filtering with `--type` to get names of specific account types
- Shows a count summary unless `--quiet` is used
- Outputs empty/nothing when no accounts match (not an error)
- Mutually exclusive with `--total` since they serve different purposes

SUCCESS
