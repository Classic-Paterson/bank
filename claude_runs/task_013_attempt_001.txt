1. **Error messages**: Replaced `⚠️` prefix with plain text ("SAFETY REQUIRED:", "Invalid destination...", etc.)
2. **Dry run mode**: Changed `🔍 DRY RUN MODE` to `[DRY RUN]`
3. **Transfer summary**: Changed `📋 TRANSFER SUMMARY` to plain `TRANSFER SUMMARY`
4. **Transfer execution**: Removed `💸` from "Executing transfer..."
5. **Status messages**:
   - Removed `✅` from "Transfer completed successfully"
   - Removed `❌` from error/declined messages
   - Removed `⏳` from timeout message
   - Removed `⚠️` from paused status
6. **Confirmation prompt**: Changed `⚠️` to `WARNING:`
7. **Summary borders**: Changed Unicode `━` to ASCII `-` for better terminal compatibility

All 299 tests pass, the build succeeds, and lint passes.
