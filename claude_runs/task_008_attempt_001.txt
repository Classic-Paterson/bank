The changes are complete. Here's a summary of what was improved:

## Summary of Changes

**Problem Identified:** Duplicate `formatRelativeTime` implementations existed in two places:
1. `src/utils/output.ts` - comprehensive version with minutes/hours granularity
2. `src/services/transaction-processing.service.ts` - compact version for table display

**Solution Implemented:**

1. **Enhanced `formatRelativeTime` in `src/utils/output.ts`** (lines 62-133):
   - Added `RelativeTimeOptions` interface with `compact` option
   - When `compact: true`:
     - Uses "today" instead of "just now" for same-day times
     - Uses abbreviated weeks ("2w ago" instead of "2 weeks ago")
     - Falls back to locale date string for times older than 30 days
   - Backward compatible - existing calls work without any changes

2. **Updated `src/services/transaction-processing.service.ts`**:
   - Removed 17-line private `formatRelativeTime` method
   - Now imports and uses the consolidated utility with `{ compact: true }`
   - Reduced file from 252 to 231 lines

3. **Added comprehensive tests in `test/utils/output.test.ts`**:
   - 9 new test cases for compact mode
   - Tests for edge cases like weeks formatting, future dates, and fallback behavior

**Benefits:**
- Single source of truth for relative time formatting
- Consistent behavior across the application
- Both verbose and compact formats available via options
- Better test coverage with 295 passing tests
- Reduced code duplication (~17 lines removed)

SUCCESS
