The implementation is complete. Here's a summary of the improvement:

## Summary

**Added `--summary` flag to the `transactions` command**

This new flag provides a quick spending summary after the transaction list, showing:
- **Income**: Total positive amounts (excluding transfers)
- **Spending**: Total negative amounts (excluding transfers)  
- **Net**: The difference (income + spending)

**User value**: Users can now get a quick financial snapshot along with their transactions without using the verbose `--details` flag. This is the "at a glance" information most users want when reviewing transactions.

**Example usage**:
```bash
bank transactions --days 30 --summary
bank transactions -s                    # shorthand
bank transactions --merchant "Countdown" --summary
```

**Changes made**:
- `src/commands/transactions.ts`: Added `--summary` flag (`-s` shorthand) with income/spending/net calculation
- `test/commands/transactions.test.ts`: Added 2 tests for the new flag

**Build/Test results**:
- Build: ✅ Passed
- Lint: ✅ Passed
- Tests: ✅ 297 passing (including 2 new tests)

SUCCESS
