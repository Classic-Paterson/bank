**Change Made:**

Fixed `formatRelativeTime` in `src/utils/output.ts` to handle future dates gracefully. Previously, if a date was in the future (which can happen with pending transactions or scheduled transfers), the function would produce confusing output like "-5m ago" due to negative time differences. 

**The fix:**
- Detects whether the date is in the future
- For future dates, returns user-friendly strings like "in 5m", "in 2d", "tomorrow", "in 3 weeks"
- For past dates, the existing behavior is preserved ("5m ago", "yesterday", etc.)

This is a correctness improvement that ensures the CLI produces trustworthy, clear output regardless of transaction timing.

SUCCESS
