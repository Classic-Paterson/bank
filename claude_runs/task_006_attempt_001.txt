The fix has been implemented and verified. Here's a summary of what was changed:

**Bug Fixed: Case-sensitivity inconsistency in search filter**

The search filter in `transaction-processing.service.ts` had an inconsistency:
- Description searches were case-insensitive (lowercasing both sides)
- Transaction ID searches were case-sensitive (exact match only)

This meant searching for `tx_ABC123` would not find a transaction with ID `tx_abc123`, which is confusing UX.

**Change made:**
- `src/services/transaction-processing.service.ts:125-132` - Changed transaction ID comparison from exact match (`tx.id === filters.search`) to case-insensitive match (`tx.id.toLowerCase() === searchTerm`)

**Test added:**
- Added a new test case "searches by transaction ID case-insensitively" to verify the fix

All 286 tests pass, build succeeds, and linting passes.

SUCCESS
