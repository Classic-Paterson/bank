All changes have been successfully implemented and verified. Here's a summary of the improvements made:

## Changes Made

### 1. MerchantMappingService In-Memory Caching (`src/services/merchant-mapping.service.ts`)
- Added in-memory cache to reduce file I/O during batch operations
- The `loadMerchantMap()` method now caches results, preventing repeated file reads when processing many transactions in the `categorise` command
- Added `invalidateCache()` method for cases where external processes may modify the file
- Cache is automatically updated on successful writes

### 2. Amount Flag Bounds Checking (`src/utils/flags.ts`)
- Added validation to reject negative amounts with clear error message: "Amount cannot be negative"
- Added upper bound check (100 billion) to prevent issues with extremely large numbers
- Both checks help fail fast at flag parsing level with user-friendly error messages

### 3. Transfer Timeout Messaging (`src/commands/transfer.ts`)
- Improved the polling timeout message to be clearer and less alarming
- Changed "timed out" messaging to explicitly state the transfer is "still processing" and "does NOT mean the transfer failed"
- Added context about current status and guidance that bank transfers can take several minutes
- Extracted `POLL_INTERVAL_MS` constant for clarity

### 4. Updated Tests
- Updated test assertions in `test/commands/transactions.test.ts` and `test/commands/query.test.ts` to match the new error message format
