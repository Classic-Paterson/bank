I've completed the first improvement. Here's a summary of what was done:

## Changes Made

**Created shared masking utility (`src/utils/mask.ts`):**
- `maskSensitiveValue()` - masks tokens/sensitive strings, showing first/last 4 chars for values ≥9 characters
- `maskAccountNumber()` - specialized masking for NZ bank account numbers (BB-****-*******-SS format)

**Updated commands to use shared utility:**
- `src/commands/settings.ts` - now imports from `utils/mask.js`
- `src/commands/transfer.ts` - removed duplicate private methods, now imports from `utils/mask.js`

**Added comprehensive tests (`test/utils/mask.test.ts`):**
- 15 test cases covering edge cases (empty string, boundary lengths, various formats)

**Benefits:**
- DRY principle: single source of truth for masking logic
- Easier to maintain and fix bugs in one place
- Consistent masking behavior across the CLI
- Better test coverage for masking functions

SUCCESS
