The improvement has been successfully implemented:

**Change Summary:**
1. **Added same-account transfer validation** in `/src/commands/transfer.ts` - The transfer command now checks if the source account's `formatted_account` matches the destination account number before attempting a transfer. If they match, it displays a clear error message: "Source and destination accounts are identical. Cannot transfer funds to the same account."

2. **Added test for safety flag requirement** in `/test/commands/transfer.test.ts` - Added a new test case that verifies the transfer command requires either `--confirm` or `--dry-run` flag for safety, ensuring the safety mechanism is properly tested.

This is a high-impact safety improvement because:
- It prevents users from accidentally initiating a pointless transfer to the same account
- It catches the error early with a clear message before wasting API calls
- It follows the existing pattern of safety checks in the transfer command (allowlist, amount validation, etc.)

SUCCESS
