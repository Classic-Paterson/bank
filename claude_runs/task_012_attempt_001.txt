## Summary

I fixed **inconsistent currency formatting** across the codebase. The CLI already had a well-implemented `formatCurrency()` function in `src/utils/output.ts` that properly formats currency with:
- NZ locale formatting with thousands separators (e.g., `$1,234.56`)
- Correct handling of negative amounts (`-$99.50`)
- Consistent 2 decimal places

However, several files were using manual `.toFixed(2)` formatting instead, which:
- Missed thousands separators (e.g., showing `$1234.56` instead of `$1,234.56`)
- Used inconsistent patterns (e.g., `$${amount.toFixed(2)}`)

### Changes made:

1. **`src/commands/transfer.ts`**:
   - Added import for `formatCurrency`
   - Line 134: Error message now uses `formatCurrency(amount)` and `formatCurrency(maxAmount)`
   - Line 235: Transfer summary amount now uses `formatCurrency(summary.amount)`

2. **`src/commands/accounts.ts`**:
   - Added import for `formatCurrency`
   - Line 91: Loan repayment amount now uses `formatCurrency()`
   - Line 93: KiwiSaver returns now uses `formatCurrency()`
   - Line 172: Total balance summary now uses `formatCurrency()`

3. **`src/commands/categorise.ts`**:
   - Added import for `formatCurrency`
   - Line 129: Transaction amount display now uses `formatCurrency()`

This makes all user-facing currency output consistent across the CLI, which is especially noticeable for amounts over $1,000 where thousands separators improve readability.

SUCCESS
