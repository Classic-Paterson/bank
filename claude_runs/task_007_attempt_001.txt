## Summary

I've made a small, high-impact improvement to the banking CLI:

### Change: NZ Bank Account Number Validation for Transfer Command

**Files Modified:**
- `src/constants/index.ts` - Added `NZ_ACCOUNT_PATTERN` regex constant for validating NZ bank account format
- `src/commands/transfer.ts` - Added validation logic that checks destination account format before attempting transfer
- `test/commands/transfer.test.ts` - Added 10 new test cases for account number validation

**What it does:**
- Validates that the `--to` destination account follows NZ bank account format: `BB-bbbb-AAAAAAA-SS(S)` 
  - BB: Bank code (2 digits)
  - bbbb: Branch code (4 digits)
  - AAAAAAA: Account number (7 digits)
  - SS(S): Suffix (2-3 digits)
- Provides a clear, helpful error message with format explanation and example when validation fails
- Prevents users from accidentally entering invalid account numbers that could cause API errors or worse

**Why this matters:**
- **Safety**: Catches typos and formatting errors before the transfer is attempted
- **UX**: Provides immediate, actionable feedback instead of cryptic API errors
- **Consistency**: Follows the existing pattern of input validation (like amount validation)

**Test Results:**
- Build: ✓ Passes
- Tests: ✓ 257 passing (10 new tests added)
- Lint: ✓ Clean

SUCCESS
