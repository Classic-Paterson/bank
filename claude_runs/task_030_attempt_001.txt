All 357 tests pass. Here's a summary of what was implemented:

## Summary

I added **merchant mapping export/import functionality** to the `settings` command. This is a high-impact user-facing feature that:

### New Commands
- `bank settings export-merchants` - Export to stdout (for piping: `bank settings export-merchants > backup.json`)
- `bank settings export-merchants <file>` - Export directly to a file
- `bank settings import-merchants <file>` - Import from a JSON file (replaces existing mappings)
- `bank settings import-merchants <file> -m` - Merge with existing mappings
- `bank settings import-merchants <file> -y` - Skip confirmation prompt

### User Benefits
1. **Backup/Restore**: Users can back up their painstaking categorization work
2. **Sharing**: Users can share configurations between machines or with others
3. **Bulk Editing**: Export → edit JSON in text editor → import back
4. **Safety**: Confirmation prompts before destructive operations

### Technical Details
- JSON validation ensures imported data has correct structure (`parent` and `category` strings)
- Merge mode (`-m`) allows incremental updates without losing existing mappings
- Error messages are helpful and actionable
- 9 new tests added for the functionality
- Fixed a pre-existing test isolation bug in the transaction processing tests

SUCCESS
