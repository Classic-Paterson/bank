## Summary

Made a small, high-impact improvement to reduce code duplication and improve maintainability:

**Changes Made:**

1. **`src/services/transaction-processing.service.ts`** - Enhanced the `generateDisplayData` method to:
   - Handle date formatting (Date objects to localized strings)
   - Added JSDoc documentation with parameter descriptions
   - Added proper return type annotation
   - Now provides complete display-ready output

2. **`src/commands/transactions.ts`** - Simplified display data generation:
   - Removed 13 lines of duplicated logic
   - Now uses the service method instead of inline transformation
   - Single line replaces date formatting + field selection logic

**Impact:**
- **DRY**: Eliminates duplicated display logic between command and service
- **Maintainability**: One place to update if display format needs to change
- **Consistency**: Service now owns all transaction presentation logic
- **No behavior change**: Output remains identical

**Verification:**
- Build passes ✓
- All 178 tests pass ✓
- ESLint clean ✓

SUCCESS
