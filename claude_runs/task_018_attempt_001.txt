The fix is in place. The change is minimal and targeted:

**What was fixed:**
- `src/commands/categories.ts:38-39`: Changed `resolveFormat(flags.format, 'table')` to `resolveFormat(flags.format)`, which now properly falls back to the user's configured default format (via `configService.get('format')`) instead of always defaulting to 'table'.

**Why this matters:**
- Before: Users who set their preferred format (e.g., `bank settings set format csv`) would see that preference ignored by the `categories` command
- After: The `categories` command respects the same format resolution as all other commands

**Build and tests:** All 314 tests pass, linting passes, and the project builds successfully.

SUCCESS
