## Summary of Changes

I added a new `--top` flag to the `transactions` command that shows the top N merchants by spending amount. This is a valuable feature for users who want to quickly see where their money is going.

**Changes made:**

1. **`src/commands/transactions.ts`**:
   - Added `--top` flag (integer) to show top N merchants by spending
   - Added validation for `--top` value (must be at least 1)
   - Updated mutually exclusive flag validation to include `--top`
   - Added logic to aggregate spending by merchant and display top N with formatted amounts
   - Added 2 new examples demonstrating the feature

2. **`test/commands/transactions.test.ts`**:
   - Updated existing test for mutually exclusive flags to include `--top` combinations
   - Added 3 new tests:
     - `handles --top flag` - verifies basic functionality
     - `rejects --top value of 0` - validates input
     - `rejects negative --top value` - validates input

**Feature behavior:**
- `bank transactions --days 30 --top 10` shows the top 10 merchants by spending amount with aligned formatting
- Works with other filters (e.g., `--direction out`, `--since`, `--parentCategory`)
- Shows a summary of total spending for the displayed merchants (unless `--quiet`)
- Mutually exclusive with `--count`, `--total`, and `--merchants` flags

SUCCESS
