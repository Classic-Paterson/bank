All 157 tests pass and linting is clean.

## Summary of Changes

I made a targeted safety improvement to prevent accidental destructive operations:

### Changes Made

**1. `src/commands/cache.ts`**
- Added confirmation prompt before clearing cache data
- Added `-y/--yes` flag to skip confirmation (for scripts/automation)
- Updated examples to show the `-y` flag usage

**2. `src/commands/settings.ts`**
- Added confirmation prompt before resetting settings to defaults
- Added `-y/--yes` flag to skip confirmation
- Updated examples to show the `-y` flag usage

**3. `test/commands/cache.test.ts`**
- Updated tests to use `-y` flag for non-interactive test execution

### Why This Matters

This change improves **Correctness & Safety** (Priority 1 from the goals):
- Prevents accidental cache clearing which could force unnecessary API calls
- Prevents accidental settings reset which could remove tokens or preferences
- Matches the safety pattern already established in the `transfer` command
- Maintains scriptability via the `-y` flag
- No new dependencies added (uses existing `inquirer` package)

SUCCESS
