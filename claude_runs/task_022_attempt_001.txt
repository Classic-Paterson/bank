All checks pass:

- ✅ Lint passes
- ✅ Build succeeds

**Summary of changes:**
Added comprehensive unit tests for `TransactionProcessingService` in `test/services/transaction-processing.service.test.ts` covering:

1. **formatTransactions** - 6 tests for transaction formatting, handling missing fields, and O(1) account lookup
2. **applyFilters** - 14 tests for all filter types (account, category, parent category, merchant, amount, type, search) including edge cases like comma-separated merchants and combined filters
3. **calculateCategoryBreakdown** - 6 tests for spending analysis by category, excluding transfers/income
4. **calculateSummary** - 3 tests for transaction summary statistics
5. **getUncategorizedTransactions** - 3 tests for identifying uncategorized transactions
6. **generateDisplayData** - 4 tests for display format generation

This is a high-impact improvement as these tests lock in the critical business logic for filtering, formatting, and categorizing financial transactions - ensuring correctness and preventing regressions.
