All 316 tests pass and the build is clean. Let me provide a summary of what was implemented:

## Summary

I've added a **period-over-period comparison feature** to the `overview` command. This is a high-impact UX improvement that makes the financial dashboard feel "smart" by showing users how their current spending compares to the previous period.

### Changes Made:

**`src/commands/overview.ts`:**
- Added `--compare` flag that enables period comparison
- Added `formatChange()` helper method that formats percentage changes with:
  - Trend arrows (↑ for increase, ↓ for decrease)
  - Color coding (green for good changes, red for bad changes)
  - Smart handling of edge cases (no previous data shows "new", zero change shows "~0%")
- Added `getPreviousPeriod()` helper to calculate the comparison period dates
- When `--compare` is enabled:
  - Fetches transactions from the previous period (same length, immediately before)
  - Shows percentage changes next to income, spending, and net
  - Shows percentage changes for each top spending category
- Added examples in the help text

**`test/commands/overview.test.ts`:**
- Added tests for `--compare` flag
- Added tests for `--compare` with `--since` flag

### Example Usage:
```bash
bank overview --compare               # Compare last 30 days with previous 30 days
bank overview --since thismonth --compare  # This month vs last month
bank overview --since thisweek --compare   # This week vs last week
```

### Example Output (with --compare):
```
  THIS PERIOD (2026-01-05 to 2026-02-04, 30 days)

  Income:    $5,000.00  ↑12%
  Spending:  -$3,200.00  ↓8%
  Net:       $1,800.00  ↑25%

  TOP SPENDING
  ████████████████████ $1,200  food  ↑15%
  ████████████░░░░░░░░   $800  utilities  ↓5%
  ██████████░░░░░░░░░░   $600  transport  new
```

SUCCESS
