The improvement is complete. Here's a summary of what was changed:

## Changes Made

### Fixed account masking inconsistency in `src/commands/transfer.ts`

**Problem:** The codebase had inconsistent account number masking:
- `maskAccountNumber()` showed `XX-****-***XXXX-XX` (revealing last 4 digits of account number part)
- `sanitizeErrorMessage()` showed `**-****-*****-**` (fully masked, no visible digits)

**Solution:**
1. Standardized masking format to `BB-****-*******-SS` (shows bank code and suffix, fully masks branch and account number)
2. Added proper format validation before masking to prevent edge case bugs
3. Updated error sanitizer regex to capture and preserve bank code and suffix for consistency

**Benefits:**
- Consistent masking across transfer summary display and error messages
- Bank code (BB) is useful for identifying which bank without revealing sensitive info
- Suffix is low-sensitivity but helps users verify correct account
- Branch and account number (the sensitive parts) are now fully masked
- Defensive validation prevents potential substring errors on malformed input

SUCCESS
