The feature is implemented correctly. Let me provide a summary of the change:

## Summary

I added a new `--topCategories` flag to the `transactions` command that shows the top N spending categories, similar to the existing `--top` flag for merchants.

### Changes Made:

1. **`src/commands/transactions.ts`**:
   - Added `--topCategories` flag definition with integer type
   - Added validation to reject values less than 1
   - Added to mutually exclusive flags check (can't be combined with `--count`, `--total`, `--merchants`, `--top`, or `--stats`)
   - Implemented handler that aggregates spending by parent category (excluding transfers and income)
   - Added two usage examples to the help text

2. **`test/commands/transactions.test.ts`**:
   - Added 6 new tests for the feature:
     - Basic functionality test
     - Validation test for value of 0
     - Validation test for negative values
     - Mutual exclusion tests with `--top`, `--count`, and `--stats`

### Usage Examples:
```bash
# Show top 5 spending categories over last 30 days
bank transactions --days 30 --topCategories 5

# Show top 3 categories this month
bank transactions --since thismonth --topCategories 3
```

The output is formatted consistently with the `--top` flag for merchants, showing category names aligned with their total spending amounts.

SUCCESS
