I've successfully added a user-friendly improvement to the banking CLI. Here's a summary of the change:

## Change Summary

**Added natural language "N days/weeks/months ago" date syntax support**

Users can now use more natural date expressions in commands like:
- `bank transactions --since "7 days ago"`
- `bank transactions --since "2 weeks ago"`
- `bank transactions --since "3 months ago"`
- `bank overview --since "1 week ago"`

This complements the existing shorthand syntax (`7d`, `2w`, `3m`) with a more readable alternative that users might naturally try when first using the CLI.

**Changes made:**
1. `src/utils/date.ts` - Added parsing for "N days ago", "N weeks ago", and "N months ago" patterns (case-insensitive)
2. `test/utils/date.test.ts` - Added 12 new test cases covering the new syntax

**Why this matters:**
- Makes the CLI feel more intuitive and "pro"
- Supports natural language that users might instinctively try
- No breaking changes - existing syntax continues to work
- Minimal code addition (~24 lines of parsing logic)
- Well-tested with comprehensive edge case coverage

SUCCESS
